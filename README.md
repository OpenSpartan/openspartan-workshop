**OpenSpartan Workshop** is a Windows-based companion application for Halo Infinite. It stores personal stats and metadata through the Halo Infinite API in a local SQLite database, and then renders relevant data through the app.

While you can use OpenSpartan Workshop to quickly see where you are career-wise or details about the matches you played, you can also run SQL queries against the local database through your SQLite client of choice (like [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)), offering unique flexibility in analyzing your in-game performance.

The benefit of using OpenSpartan Workshop is that for any more complex analysis than basic stats you don't really need to interact with the API - all data is stored locally and analysis performance or preferences can be scaled depending on the resources available to you personally (even when offline).
